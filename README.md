# Personal Portfolio Website - Ujwala Mandali

It's a fully responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as an AI & Data Science Developer. The site features a modern, dark, AI-inspired theme with interactive elements to create an engaging user experience.
